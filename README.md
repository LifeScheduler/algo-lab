# algo-lab
Laboratory for algorithms. Use experimental approach to study algorithms. Implementations in rust.

# Draft (General ideas that will be used to make the experiments possible)
- the tests will be carried on algorithms or programs that are correct, thus, they
must be thoroughly tested before the experiments.
- The experimental approach to the study of algorithms is in between the theoretical
and empirical approach. It differs from empirical approach because it treats
algorithms as laboratory subjects, including control of parameters, isolation
of key components, model building, and statistical analysis.
- The algorithm design hierarchy: system structure, algorithm and data structure
design, implementation and algorithm tuning, code tuning, system software, and
platform and hardware. Each of those dimensions represent broad strategies for
speeding up algorithms.
